# SFND 3D Object Tracking

Welcome to the final project of the camera course. By completing all the lessons, you now have a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, you know how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, you know how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space. Let's take a look at our program schematic to see what we already have accomplished and what's still missing.

<img src="images/course_code_structure.png" width="779" height="414" />

In this final project, you will implement the missing parts in the schematic. To do this, you will complete four major tasks: 
1. First, you will develop a way to match 3D objects over time by using keypoint correspondences. 
2. Second, you will compute the TTC based on Lidar measurements. 
3. You will then proceed to do the same using the camera, which requires to first associate keypoint matches to regions of interest and then to compute the TTC based on those matches. 
4. And lastly, you will conduct various tests with the framework. Your goal is to identify the most suitable detector/descriptor combination for TTC estimation and also to search for problems that can lead to faulty measurements by the camera or Lidar sensor. In the last course of this Nanodegree, you will learn about the Kalman filter, which is a great way to combine the two independent TTC measurements into an improved version which is much more reliable than a single sensor alone can be. But before we think about such things, let us focus on your final project in the camera course.

## FP.1 : Match 3D Objects
In this task, please implement the method "matchBoundingBoxes", which takes as input both the previous and the current data frames and provides as output the ids of the matched regions of interest (i.e. the boxID property)â€œ. Matches must be the ones with the highest number of keypoint correspondences.
-> I use `multimap<int, int> boxmap{}` to store the pairs of boinding box ID.

```
void matchBoundingBoxes(std::vector<cv::DMatch> &matches, std::map<int, int> &bbBestMatches, DataFrame &prevFrame, DataFrame &currFrame)
{
    // ...
    multimap<int, int> boxmap{};
    for (auto match:matches) {
        cv::KeyPoint prevPoints = prevFrame.keypoints[match.queryIdx];
        cv::KeyPoint currPoints = currFrame.keypoints[match.trainIdx];
        int prevBoxId = -1;
        int currBoxId = -1;

        for (auto box:prevFrame.boundingBoxes) {
            if (box.roi.contains(prevPoints.pt)) prevBoxId = box.boxID;
        }
        for (auto box:currFrame.boundingBoxes) {
            if (box.roi.contains(currPoints.pt)) currBoxId = box.boxID;
        }
        // generate currBoxId-prevBoxId map pair
        boxmap.insert({currBoxId, prevBoxId});

    }
    int CurrBoxSize = currFrame.boundingBoxes.size();
    int prevBoxSize = prevFrame.boundingBoxes.size();
    // find the best matched previous boundingbox for each current boudingbox
    for (int i = 0; i < CurrBoxSize; ++i) {
        auto boxmapPair = boxmap.equal_range(i);
        vector<int> currBoxCount(prevBoxSize, 0);
        for (auto pr = boxmapPair.first; pr != boxmapPair.second; ++pr) {
            if (-1 != (*pr).second) currBoxCount[(*pr).second] += 1;
        }
        // find the position of best prev box which has highest number of keypoint correspondences.
        int maxPosition = std::distance(currBoxCount.begin(),
                                        std::max_element(currBoxCount.begin(), currBoxCount.end()));
        bbBestMatches.insert({maxPosition, i});
        cout<<"Current BoxID: "<<i<<" match Previous BoxID: "<<maxPosition<<endl;
    }
}
```
## FP.2 : Compute Lidar-based TTC
In this part of the final project, your task is to compute the time-to-collision for all matched 3D objects based on Lidar measurements alone. 
-> I used the mean value of x-distacne to reduce the impact of outliers
```
void computeTTCLidar(std::vector<LidarPoint> &lidarPointsPrev,
                 std::vector<LidarPoint> &lidarPointsCurr, double frameRate, double &TTC)
{
    double dT=1/frameRate;
    double laneWidth=4.0;
    vector<double> lidarPointsCurrX,lidarPointsPrevX;
    for(auto it =lidarPointsPrev.begin();it!=lidarPointsPrev.end();++it){
        if(abs(it->y)<=laneWidth/2.0){
            lidarPointsPrevX.push_back(it->x);
        }
    }
    for (auto it = lidarPointsCurr.begin(); it != lidarPointsCurr.end(); ++it)
    {

        if (abs(it->y) <= laneWidth / 2.0){
            lidarPointsCurrX.push_back(it->x);
        }
    }
        double XCurrSum = accumulate(lidarPointsCurrX.begin(), lidarPointsCurrX.end(), 0.0);
        double XPrevSum = accumulate(lidarPointsPrevX.begin(), lidarPointsPrevX.end(), 0.0);
        double CurrMean = XCurrSum / lidarPointsCurrX.size();
        double PrevMean = XPrevSum / lidarPointsPrevX.size();
        double Curraccum = 0.0;
        double Prevaccum = 0.0;
        for_each(begin(lidarPointsCurrX), std::end(lidarPointsCurrX), [&](const double d) {
            Curraccum += (d - XCurrSum) * (d - XCurrSum);
        });

        double CurrStd = sqrt(Curraccum / (lidarPointsCurrX.size() - 1));

        for_each(begin(lidarPointsPrevX), std::end(lidarPointsPrevX), [&](const double d) {
            Prevaccum += (d - XPrevSum) * (d - XPrevSum);
        });

        double PrevStd = sqrt(Prevaccum / (lidarPointsPrevX.size() - 1));
        int CurrCount = 0;
        int PrevCount = 0;
        double CurrAns = 0;
        double PrevAns = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < lidarPointsCurrX.size(); ++i) {
            if (abs(lidarPointsCurrX[i] - CurrMean) < 3 * CurrStd) {
                CurrAns += lidarPointsCurrX[i];
                ++CurrCount;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < lidarPointsPrevX.size(); ++i) {
            if (abs(lidarPointsPrevX[i] - PrevMean) < 3 * PrevStd) {
                PrevAns += lidarPointsPrevX[i];
                ++PrevCount;
            }
        }
        
        double d1 = CurrAns / CurrCount;
        double d0 = PrevAns / PrevCount;
        TTC = d1 * dT / (d0 - d1);
    }

}
```
## FP.3 : Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes
Before a TTC estimate can be computed in the next exercise, you need to find all keypoint matches that belong to each 3D object. You can do this by simply checking whether the corresponding keypoints are within the region of interest in the camera image. All matches which satisfy this condition should be added to a vector. The problem you will find is that there will be outliers among your matches. To eliminate those, I recommend that you compute a robust mean of all the euclidean distances between keypoint matches and then remove those that are too far away from the mean.
```
void clusterKptMatchesWithROI(BoundingBox &boundingBox, std::vector<cv::KeyPoint> &kptsPrev,
                              std::vector<cv::KeyPoint> &kptsCurr, std::vector<cv::DMatch> &kptMatches) {

    double mean_distance = 0.0;
    vector<cv::DMatch> inside_matches;
    for (auto match: kptMatches) {
        cv::KeyPoint currPoints = kptsCurr[match.trainIdx];
        if (boundingBox.roi.contains(currPoints.pt)) {
            inside_matches.push_back(match);
        }
    }

    for (auto inside_match:inside_matches) {
        mean_distance += inside_match.distance;
    }
    if (inside_matches.size() > 0) {
        mean_distance = mean_distance / inside_matches.size();
    } else {
        return;
    }
    //
    for (auto inside_match:inside_matches) {
        if (inside_match.distance < mean_distance) {
            boundingBox.kptMatches.push_back(inside_match);
        }
    }

}
```
### FP.4 : Compute Camera-based TTC
Once keypoint matches have been added to the bounding boxes, the next step is to compute the TTC estimate.
![](images/TTC_Cam_1.png)
![](images/TTC_Cam_2.png)
```
void computeTTCCamera(std::vector<cv::KeyPoint> &kptsPrev, std::vector<cv::KeyPoint> &kptsCurr, 
                      std::vector<cv::DMatch> kptMatches, double frameRate, double &TTC, cv::Mat *visImg)
{
    vector<double> distRatios; // stores the distance ratios for all keypoints between curr. and prev. frame
    for (auto it1 = kptMatches.begin(); it1 != kptMatches.end() - 1; ++it1)
    { // outer kpt. loop

        // get current keypoint and its matched partner in the prev. frame
        cv::KeyPoint kpOuterCurr = kptsCurr.at(it1->trainIdx);
        cv::KeyPoint kpOuterPrev = kptsPrev.at(it1->queryIdx);

        for (auto it2 = kptMatches.begin() + 1; it2 != kptMatches.end(); ++it2)
        { // inner kpt.-loop

            double minDist = 100.0; // min. required distance

            // get next keypoint and its matched partner in the prev. frame
            cv::KeyPoint kpInnerCurr = kptsCurr.at(it2->trainIdx);
            cv::KeyPoint kpInnerPrev = kptsPrev.at(it2->queryIdx);

            // compute distances and distance ratios
            double distCurr = cv::norm(kpOuterCurr.pt - kpInnerCurr.pt);
            double distPrev = cv::norm(kpOuterPrev.pt - kpInnerPrev.pt);

            if (distPrev > std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon() && distCurr >= minDist)
            { // avoid division by zero

                double distRatio = distCurr / distPrev;
                distRatios.push_back(distRatio);
            }
        } // eof inner loop over all matched kpts
    }     // eof outer loop over all matched kpts

    // only continue if list of distance ratios is not empty
    if (distRatios.size() == 0)
    {
        TTC = NAN;
        return;
    }
    std::sort(distRatios.begin(), distRatios.end());
    int distRatioSize= distRatios.size();
    double medianDistRatio = distRatioSize%2==0? (distRatios[distRatioSize/ 2-1]+distRatios[distRatioSize/2])/2:distRatios[distRatioSize/2];

    // Finally, calculate a TTC estimate based on these 2D camera features
    TTC = (-1.0 / frameRate) / (1 - medianDistRatio);

}
```

## FP.5 : Performance Evaluation 1
Look for several examples where you have the impression that the Lidar-based TTC estimate is way off. Once you have found those, describe your observations and provide a sound argumentation why you think this happened.
-> I dind't find any frame which Lidar-TTC is way off. Using mean value makes reducing the impact of outlier. 


## FP.6 : Performance Evaluation 2
This last exercise is about running the different detector / descriptor combinations and looking at the differences in TTC estimation. Find out which methods perform best and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off
